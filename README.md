# Shopping-cart

React project of a store website with more than one page and a shopping cart. I used React Router to change pages. You can add items to the shopping cart and the total amount is calculated. The number of items is also counted in the cart and duplicate items are counted as well. The cart items also save to localstorage. The project was styled using Material UI.
